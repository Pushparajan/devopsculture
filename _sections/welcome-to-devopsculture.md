As [Nicole Forsgren](https://twitter.com/nicolefv) so adroitly explains, [Metrics Shape Your Culture](https://vimeo.com/173607646). Once you start measuring something, and make it a metric of success, people will naturally start figuring out how to game the systems.**This isn't a bad thing!** If you set your metrics up so that gaming the system results in the desired outcome, then the metrics are a good thing.

To this end, we can establish metrics that will help drive the cultural outcomes we wish to see on our teams. We have more than enough tools to measure efficiencies and delivery, but yet we're lacking in applying the same rigors of measurement and assessment to the most underappreciated and critical facet of how we work as technologists: **team culture**.

This project serves as a collaboration point to collect new metrics and measurement tools as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are designed to encourage improving team culture.
