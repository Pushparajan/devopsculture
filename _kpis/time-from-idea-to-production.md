# Time From Idea to Production
Agility, rather than efficiency, is critical for digital business transformation. An organization needs to be able to pivot quickly to changing customer needs and demands. Technologists are used to solving for efficiencies, making their work, or the organizations' pipelines faster and less labor-intensive. But we often over-optimize in the technology areas that are easy to solve, forgetting about the technology-light pipelines that exist before and after the developer's work. If we refocus success to be a measurment of the end-to-end time, then we'll find ways to eliminate other non-obvious bottlenecks, and be able to deliver work to production faster. By making the entire end-to-end team responsible for this metric, crossfunctional teams targeted to specific business goals should naturally begin to form, breaking down traditional departmental silos. (if encouraged of course!)

This is most successfull if the entire idea pipeline is captured in JIRA or other ticket tracking system, including the initial concept ideation work performed by Product Owners or business teams.
