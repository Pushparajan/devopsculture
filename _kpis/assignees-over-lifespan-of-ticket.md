# Number of Assignees Over Lifespan of Ticket
If a ticket bounces around between a lot of people, that's a good indication that there may be problems with process, understanding, team coordination, or communication challenges. The fewer the people necessary to route and complete a ticket, the more certain we can be that the team is taking ownership of work and reducing unnecessary context switching.

## Formula
## Maturity
## Improving
1. Look for ways to automate triage steps on bug tickets, so they get to the right person with fewer steps.
2. Try adopting techniques to do [bug triage as a team](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/293339/when-to-have-bug-triage-meetings-in-scrum-process) so that everyone is aware of the ticket and it can get to the right person.
3. Manage your flow by reducing the number of tickets in progress at once. Often teams bounce tickets around excessively based on capacity.
4. Introduce Test Driven Development, so clear technical specs are produced before introducing functional code.
5. Automate unit testing.
6. Automate QA validation.
