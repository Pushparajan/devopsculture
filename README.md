## Purpose
As Nicole Forgresn so adroitly explains, [Metrics Shape Your Culture](https://vimeo.com/173607646). Once you start measuring something, and make it a metric of success, people will naturally start figuring out how to game the systems.**This isn't a bad thing!** If you set your metrics up so that gaming the system results in the desired outcome, then the metrics are a good thing.

To this end, we can establish metrics that will help drive the cultural outcomes we wish to see on our teams. We have more than enough tools to measure efficiencies and delivery, but yet we're lacking in applying the same rigors of measurement and assessment to the most underappreciated and critical facet of how we work as technologists: **team culture**.

This project serves as a collaboration point to collect new metrics and measurement tools that are designed to measure culture.

### Structure
Each KPI below is explained in how it should affect cultural change when adopted, how to calculate it, and an assessment scale for use in reporting dashboards.
1. **Description** - An introduction to the KPI and how it will provide business value
2. **Formula** - How the KPI is calculated
3. **Maturity** - An index-based model for abstracting the KPI into a score that's measurable over time in trending dashboards
4. **Recommendations** - Tips and suggestions for how to encourage improvements
